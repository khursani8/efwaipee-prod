To prevent this behavior, set\n\t *     `transformRequest` to an empty array: `transformRequest: []`\n\t *   - **`transformResponse`** –\n\t *     `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –\n\t *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n\t *     response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized)\n\t *     version.\n\t *     By default, transformResponse will contain one function that checks if the response looks\n\t *     like a JSON string and deserializes it using `angular.fromJson`. To prevent this behavior,\n\t *     set `transformResponse` to an empty array: `transformResponse: []`\n\t *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n\t *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n\t *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory} is supplied, this cache will be used for\n\t *     caching.\n\t *   - **`timeout`** – `{number}` – timeout in milliseconds.<br />\n\t *     **Note:** In contrast to {@link ng.$http#usage $http.config}, {@link ng.$q promises} are\n\t *     **not** supported in $resource, because the same value would be used for multiple requests.\n\t *     If you are looking for a way to cancel requests, you should use the `cancellable` option.\n\t *   - **`cancellable`** – `{boolean}` – if set to true, the request made by a \"non-instance\" call\n\t *     will be cancelled (if not already completed) by calling `$cancelRequest()` on the call's\n\t *     return value. Calling `$cancelRequest()` for a non-cancellable or an already\n\t *     completed/cancelled request will have no effect.<br />\n\t *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n\t *     XHR object. See\n\t *     [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5)\n\t *     for more information.\n\t *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see\n\t *     [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).\n\t *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -\n\t *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called\n\t *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Object} options Hash with custom settings that should extend the\n\t *   default `$resourceProvider` behavior.  The supported options are:\n\t *\n\t *   - **`stripTrailingSlashes`** – {boolean} – If true then the trailing\n\t *   slashes from any calculated URL will be stripped. (Defaults to true.)\n\t *   - **`cancellable`** – {boolean} – If true, the request made by a \"non-instance\" call will be\n\t *   cancelled (if not already completed) by calling `$cancelRequest()` on the call's return value.\n\t *   This can be overwritten per action. (Defaults to false.)\n\t *\n\t * @returns {Object} A resource \"class\" object with methods for the default set of resource actions\n\t *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:\n\t *   ```js\n\t *   { 'get':    {method:'GET'},\n\t *     'save':   {method:'POST'},\n\t *     'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},\n\t *     'remove': {method:'DELETE'},\n\t *     'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };\n\t *   ```\n\t *\n\t *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,\n\t *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an\n\t *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it\n\t *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,\n\t *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:\n\t *   ```js\n\t *   var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n\t *   var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {\n\t *     user.abc = true;\n\t *     user.$save();\n\t *   });\n\t *   ```\n\t *\n\t *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an\n\t *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the\n\t *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since\n\t *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty\n\t *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is\n\t *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This\n\t *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.\n\t *\n\t *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following\n\t *   parameters:\n\t *\n\t *   - HTTP GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n\t *   - non-GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`\n\t *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n\t *\n\t *\n\t *   Success callback is called with (value (Object|Array), responseHeaders (Function),\n\t *   status (number), statusText (string)) arguments, where the value is the populated resource\n\t *   instance or collection object. The error callback is called with (httpResponse) argument.\n\t *\n\t *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).\n\t *   Instance actions return promise of the action.\n\t *\n\t *   The Resource instances and collections have these additional properties:\n\t *\n\t *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this\n\t *     instance or collection.\n\t *\n\t *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,\n\t *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in\n\t *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view\n\t *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.\n\t *\n\t *     On failure, the promise is rejected with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without\n\t *     the `resource` property.\n\t *\n\t *     If an interceptor object was provided, the promise will instead be resolved with the value\n\t *     returned by the interceptor.\n\t *\n\t *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or\n\t *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in\n\t *      data-binding.\n\t *\n\t *   The Resource instances and collections have these additional methods:\n\t *\n\t *   - `$cancelRequest`: If there is a cancellable, pending request related to the instance or\n\t *      collection, calling this method will abort the request.\n\t *\n\t *   The Resource instances have these additional methods:\n\t *\n\t *   - `toJSON`: It returns a simple object without any of the extra properties added as part of\n\t *     the Resource API. This object can be serialized through {@link angular.toJson} safely\n\t *     without attaching Angular-specific fields. Notice that `JSON.stringify` (and\n\t *     `angular.toJson`) automatically use this method when serializing a Resource instance\n\t *     (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#toJSON()_behavior)).\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * # Credit card resource\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t     // Define CreditCard class\n\t     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',\n\t      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {\n\t       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}\n\t      });\n\t\n\t     // We can retrieve a collection from the server\n\t     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {\n\t       // GET: /user/123/card\n\t       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];\n\t\n\t       var card = cards[0];\n\t       // each item is an instance of CreditCard\n\t       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);\n\t       card.name = \"J.

Smith'}\n\t       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};\n\t\n\t       // our custom method is mapped as well.\n\t       card.$charge({amount:9.99});\n\t       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J.

This allows you to easily support CRUD\n\t * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.\n\t\n\t   ```js\n\t     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n\t     User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {\n\t       user.abc = true;\n\t       user.$save();\n\t     });\n\t   ```\n\t *\n\t * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other methods gets passed\n\t * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one\n\t * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:\n\t *\n\t   ```js\n\t     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n\t     User.get({userId:123}, function(user, getResponseHeaders){\n\t       user.abc = true;\n\t       user.$save(function(user, putResponseHeaders) {\n\t         //user => saved user object\n\t         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter\n\t       });\n\t     });\n\t   ```\n\t *\n\t * You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned\n\t *\n\t   ```\n\t     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n\t     User.get({userId:123})\n\t         .$promise.then(function(user) {\n\t           $scope.user = user;\n\t         });\n\t   ```\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * # Creating a custom 'PUT' request\n\t *\n\t * In this example we create a custom method on our resource to make a PUT request\n\t * ```js\n\t *    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource', 'ngRoute']);\n\t *\n\t *    // Some APIs expect a PUT request in the format URL/object/ID\n\t *    // Here we are creating an 'update' method\n\t *    app.factory('Notes', ['$resource', function($resource) {\n\t *    return $resource('/notes/:id', null,\n\t *        {\n\t *            'update': { method:'PUT' }\n\t *        });\n\t *    }]);\n\t *\n\t *    // In our controller we get the ID from the URL using ngRoute and $routeParams\n\t *    // We pass in $routeParams and our Notes factory along with $scope\n\t *    app.controller('NotesCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Notes',\n\t                                      function($scope, $routeParams, Notes) {\n\t *    // First get a note object from the factory\n\t *    var note = Notes.get({ id:$routeParams.id });\n\t *    $id = note.id;\n\t *\n\t *    // Now call update passing in the ID first then the object you are updating\n\t *    Notes.update({ id:$id }, note);\n\t *\n\t *    // This will PUT /notes/ID with the note object in the request payload\n\t *    }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * # Cancelling requests\n\t *\n\t * If an action's configuration specifies that it is cancellable, you can cancel the request related\n\t * to an instance or collection (as long as it is a result of a \"non-instance\" call):\n\t *\n\t   ```js\n\t     // ...defining the `Hotel` resource...\n\t     var Hotel = $resource('/api/hotel/:id', {id: '@id'}, {\n\t       // Let's make the `query()` method cancellable\n\t       query: {method: 'get', isArray: true, cancellable: true}\n\t     });\n\t\n\t     // ...somewhere in the PlanVacationController...\n\t     ...\n\t     this.onDestinationChanged = function onDestinationChanged(destination) {\n\t       // We don't care about any pending request for hotels\n\t       // in a different destination any more\n\t       this.availableHotels.$cancelRequest();\n\t\n\t       // Let's query for hotels in '<destination>'\n\t       // (calls: /api/hotel?location=<destination>)\n\t       this.availableHotels = Hotel.query({location: destination});\n\t     };\n\t   ```\n\t *\n\t */\n\tangular.module('ngResource', ['ng']).\n\t  info({ angularVersion: '1.6.3' }).\n\t  provider('$resource', function ResourceProvider() {\n\t    var PROTOCOL_AND_IPV6_REGEX = /^https?:\\/\\/\\[[^\\]]*][^/]*/;\n\t\n\t    var provider = this;\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * @ngdoc property\n\t     * @name $resourceProvider#defaults\n\t     * @description\n\t     * Object containing default options used when creating `$resource` instances.\n\t     *\n\t     * The default values satisfy a wide range of usecases, but you may choose to overwrite any of\n\t     * them to further customize your instances.

If you need this sequence to appear and not collapse then you\n *   can escape it with `/\\.`.\n *\n * @param {Object=} paramDefaults Default values for `url` parameters. These can be overridden in\n *   `actions` methods. If a parameter value is a function, it will be called every time\n *   a param value needs to be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden). The function\n *   will be passed the current data value as an argument.\n *\n *   Each key value in the parameter object is first bound to url template if present and then any\n *   excess keys are appended to the url search query after the `?`.\n *\n *   Given a template `/path/:verb` and parameter `{verb:'greet', salutation:'Hello'}` results in\n *   URL `/path/greet?salutation=Hello`.\n *\n *   If the parameter value is prefixed with `@`, then the value for that parameter will be\n *   extracted from the corresponding property on the `data` object (provided when calling a\n *   \"non-GET\" action method).\n *   For example, if the `defaultParam` object is `{someParam: '@someProp'}` then the value of\n *   `someParam` will be `data.someProp`.\n *   Note that the parameter will be ignored, when calling a \"GET\" action method (i.e. an action\n *   method that does not accept a request body)\n *\n * @param {Object.<Object>=} actions Hash with declaration of custom actions that will be available\n *   in addition to the default set of resource actions (see below). If a custom action has the same\n *   key as a default action (e.g. `save`), then the default action will be *overwritten*, and not\n *   extended.\n *\n *   The declaration should be created in the format of {@link ng.$http#usage $http.config}:\n *\n *       {action1: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},\n *        action2: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},\n *        ...}\n *\n *   Where:\n *\n *   - **`action`** – {string} – The name of action. This name becomes the name of the method on\n *     your resource object.\n *   - **`method`** – {string} – Case insensitive HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,\n *     `DELETE`, `JSONP`, etc).\n *   - **`params`** – {Object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action. If any of\n *     the parameter value is a function, it will be called every time when a param value needs to\n *     be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden). The function will be passed the\n *     current data value as an argument.\n *   - **`url`** – {string} – action specific `url` override. The url templating is supported just\n *     like for the resource-level urls.\n *   - **`isArray`** – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array,\n *     see `returns` section.\n *   - **`transformRequest`** –\n *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n *     request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n *     By default, transformRequest will contain one function that checks if the request data is\n *     an object and serializes it using `angular.toJson`. To prevent this behavior, set\n *     `transformRequest` to an empty array: `transformRequest: []`\n *   - **`transformResponse`** –\n *     `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –\n *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n *     response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized)\n *     version.\n *     By default, transformResponse will contain one function that checks if the response looks\n *     like a JSON string and deserializes it using `angular.fromJson`. To prevent this behavior,\n *     set `transformResponse` to an empty array: `transformResponse: []`\n *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory} is supplied, this cache will be used for\n *     caching.\n *   - **`timeout`** – `{number}` – timeout in milliseconds.<br />\n *     **Note:** In contrast to {@link ng.$http#usage $http.config}, {@link ng.$q promises} are\n *     **not** supported in $resource, because the same value would be used for multiple requests.\n *     If you are looking for a way to cancel requests, you should use the `cancellable` option.\n *   - **`cancellable`** – `{boolean}` – if set to true, the request made by a \"non-instance\" call\n *     will be cancelled (if not already completed) by calling `$cancelRequest()` on the call's\n *     return value. Calling `$cancelRequest()` for a non-cancellable or an already\n *     completed/cancelled request will have no effect.<br />\n *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n *     XHR object. See\n *     [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5)\n *     for more information.\n *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see\n *     [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).\n *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -\n *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called\n *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.\n *\n * @param {Object} options Hash with custom settings that should extend the\n *   default `$resourceProvider` behavior.  The supported options are:\n *\n *   - **`stripTrailingSlashes`** – {boolean} – If true then the trailing\n *   slashes from any calculated URL will be stripped. (Defaults to true.)\n *   - **`cancellable`** – {boolean} – If true, the request made by a \"non-instance\" call will be\n *   cancelled (if not already completed) by calling `$cancelRequest()` on the call's return value.\n *   This can be overwritten per action. (Defaults to false.)\n *\n * @returns {Object} A resource \"class\" object with methods for the default set of resource actions\n *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:\n *   ```js\n *   { 'get':    {method:'GET'},\n *     'save':   {method:'POST'},\n *     'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},\n *     'remove': {method:'DELETE'},\n *     'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };\n *   ```\n *\n *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,\n *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an\n *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it\n *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,\n *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:\n *   ```js\n *   var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n *   var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {\n *     user.abc = true;\n *     user.$save();\n *   });\n *   ```\n *\n *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an\n *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the\n *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since\n *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty\n *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is\n *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This\n *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.\n *\n *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following\n *   parameters:\n *\n *   - HTTP GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n *   - non-GET \"class\" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`\n *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`\n *\n *\n *   Success callback is called with (value (Object|Array), responseHeaders (Function),\n *   status (number), statusText (string)) arguments, where the value is the populated resource\n *   instance or collection object. The error callback is called with (httpResponse) argument.\n *\n *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).\n *   Instance actions return promise of the action.\n *\n *   The Resource instances and collections have these additional properties:\n *\n *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this\n *     instance or collection.\n *\n *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,\n *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in\n *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view\n *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.\n *\n *     On failure, the promise is rejected with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without\n *     the `resource` property.\n *\n *     If an interceptor object was provided, the promise will instead be resolved with the value\n *     returned by the interceptor.\n *\n *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or\n *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in\n *      data-binding.\n *\n *   The Resource instances and collections have these additional methods:\n *\n *   - `$cancelRequest`: If there is a cancellable, pending request related to the instance or\n *      collection, calling this method will abort the request.\n *\n *   The Resource instances have these additional methods:\n *\n *   - `toJSON`: It returns a simple object without any of the extra properties added as part of\n *     the Resource API. This object can be serialized through {@link angular.toJson} safely\n *     without attaching Angular-specific fields. Notice that `JSON.stringify` (and\n *     `angular.toJson`) automatically use this method when serializing a Resource instance\n *     (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#toJSON()_behavior)).\n *\n * @example\n *\n * # Credit card resource\n *\n * ```js\n     // Define CreditCard class\n     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',\n      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {\n       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}\n      });\n\n     // We can retrieve a collection from the server\n     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {\n       // GET: /user/123/card\n       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];\n\n       var card = cards[0];\n       // each item is an instance of CreditCard\n       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);\n       card.name = \"J. Smith\";\n       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances\n       card.$save();\n       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}\n       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};\n\n       // our custom method is mapped as well.\n       card.$charge({amount:9.99});\n       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}\n     });\n\n     // we can create an instance as well\n     var newCard = new CreditCard({number:'0123'});\n     newCard.name = \"Mike Smith\";\n     newCard.$save();\n     // POST: /user/123/card {number:'0123', name:'Mike Smith'}\n     // server returns: {id:789, number:'0123', name: 'Mike Smith'};\n     expect(newCard.id).toEqual(789);\n * ```\n *\n * The object returned from this function execution is a resource \"class\" which has \"static\" method\n * for each action in the definition.\n *\n * Calling these methods invoke `$http` on the `url` template with the given `method`, `params` and\n * `headers`.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * # User resource\n *\n * When the data is returned from the server then the object is an instance of the resource type and\n * all of the non-GET methods are available with `$` prefix. This allows you to easily support CRUD\n * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.\n\n   ```js\n     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n     User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {\n       user.abc = true;\n       user.$save();\n     });\n   ```\n *\n * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other methods gets passed\n * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one\n * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:\n *\n   ```js\n     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n     User.get({userId:123}, function(user, getResponseHeaders){\n       user.abc = true;\n       user.$save(function(user, putResponseHeaders) {\n         //user => saved user object\n         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter\n       });\n     });\n   ```\n *\n * You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned\n *\n   ```\n     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});\n     User.get({userId:123})\n         .$promise.then(function(user) {\n           $scope.user = user;\n         });\n   ```\n *\n * @example\n *\n * # Creating a custom 'PUT' request\n *\n * In this example we create a custom method on our resource to make a PUT request\n * ```js\n *    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource', 'ngRoute']);\n *\n *    // Some APIs expect a PUT request in the format URL/object/ID\n *    // Here we are creating an 'update' method\n *    app.factory('Notes', ['$resource', function($resource) {\n *    return $resource('/notes/:id', null,\n *        {\n *            'update': { method:'PUT' }\n *        });\n *    }]);\n *\n *    // In our controller we get the ID from the URL using ngRoute and $routeParams\n *    // We pass in $routeParams and our Notes factory along with $scope\n *    app.controller('NotesCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Notes',\n                                      function($scope, $routeParams, Notes) {\n *    // First get a note object from the factory\n *    var note = Notes.get({ id:$routeParams.id });\n *    $id = note.id;\n *\n *    // Now call update passing in the ID first then the object you are updating\n *    Notes.update({ id:$id }, note);\n *\n *    // This will PUT /notes/ID with the note object in the request payload\n *    }]);\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n *\n * # Cancelling requests\n *\n * If an action's configuration specifies that it is cancellable, you can cancel the request related\n * to an instance or collection (as long as it is a result of a \"non-instance\" call):\n *\n   ```js\n     // ...defining the `Hotel` resource...\n     var Hotel = $resource('/api/hotel/:id', {id: '@id'}, {\n       // Let's make the `query()` method cancellable\n       query: {method: 'get', isArray: true, cancellable: true}\n     });\n\n     // ...somewhere in the PlanVacationController...\n     ...\n     this.onDestinationChanged = function onDestinationChanged(destination) {\n       // We don't care about any pending request for hotels\n       // in a different destination any more\n       this.availableHotels.$cancelRequest();\n\n       // Let's query for hotels in '<destination>'\n       // (calls: /api/hotel?location=<destination>)\n       this.availableHotels = Hotel.query({location: destination});\n     };\n   ```\n *\n */\nangular.module('ngResource', ['ng']).\n  info({ angularVersion: '1.6.3' }).\n  provider('$resource', function ResourceProvider() {\n    var PROTOCOL_AND_IPV6_REGEX = /^https?:\\/\\/\\[[^\\]]*][^/]*/;\n\n    var provider = this;\n\n    /**\n     * @ngdoc property\n     * @name $resourceProvider#defaults\n     * @description\n     * Object containing default options used when creating `$resource` instances.\n     *\n     * The default values satisfy a wide range of usecases, but you may choose to overwrite any of\n     * them to further customize your instances.

Through the One-Stop Shop and the Office of all Aids, we seek to get you registered for the course that you need and assist you in applying for financial aid / sponsorship. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Graduation Office helps to facilitate your transition from a student to a degree-holding graduate and researcher while you are at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, and in the years beyond graduation</p>\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"card-action\\\">\\r\\n              <a href=\\\"https://www.utp.edu.my/Academic/cgs/SitePages/Home.aspx\\\">Home</a>\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n          </div>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n      <div class=\\\"card-panel blue darken-1 text-center flow-text\\\">\\r\\n          <a class=\\\"white-text\\\" ng-href=\\\"/ar.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">AR</a>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n      <a href=\\\"/thesis\\\">\\r\\n      <div class=\\\"col s12 m4\\\">\\r\\n        <div class=\\\"card-panel blue darken-1 text-center flow-text\\\">\\r\\n          <span class=\\\"white-text\\\">CGS</span>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n      </a>\\r\\n      <a href=\\\"/qrrecognizer\\\">\\r\\n      <div class=\\\"col s12 m4\\\">\\r\\n        <div class=\\\"card-panel blue darken-1 text-center flow-text\\\">\\r\\n          <span class=\\\"white-text\\\">Examiner</span>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n      </a>\\r\\n      <a href=\\\"/dashboard\\\">\\r\\n      <div class=\\\"col s12 m4\\\">\\r\\n        <div class=\\\"card-panel blue darken-1 text-center flow-text\\\">\\r\\n          <span class=\\\"white-text\\\">Student</span>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n      </a>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./client/app/main/main.html\n// module id = 490\n// module chunks = 2","module.exports = \"<div class=\\\"container\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"col s4\\\">\\r\\n            <div id=\\\"qrcode\\\"></div>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n        <div class=\\\"col s8\\\">\\r\\n            <div class=\\\"input-field\\\">\\r\\n                <input type=\\\"text\\\" ng-change=\\\"generateQR({'text':thesisId,foreground:'#2196F3'})\\\" id=\\\"thesisId\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" placeholder=\\\"thesis id\\\" ng-model=\\\"thesisId \\\">\\r\\n            </div>\\r\\n            <div>{{thesisId}}</div>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n  <script>\\r\\n\\r\\n    $('#thesisId').autocomplete({\\r\\n        data: {\\r\\n            \\\"19137\\\": null,\\r\\n            \\\"17989\\\": null,\\r\\n            \\\"19073\\\": null\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        limit: 20, // The max amount of results that can be shown at once.
