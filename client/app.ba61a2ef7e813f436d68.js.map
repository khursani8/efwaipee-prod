Our mission is to guide and support students throughout their university experience from admission to graduation. If you are a student, our goal is simple: to promote your success. \\r\\n \\r\\nThrough the Office of Admissions, we hope to facilitate your smooth entry into the University. Through the One-Stop Shop and the Office of all Aids, we seek to get you registered for the course that you need and assist you in applying for financial aid / sponsorship. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Graduation Office helps to facilitate your transition from a student to a degree-holding graduate and researcher while you are at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, and in the years beyond graduation</p>\\r\\n
